    "The datasets are provided by the [Finnish Meteorological Institute](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/) and the [European Environmental Agency](https://discomap.eea.europa.eu/map/fme/AirQualityExport.htm). The aim of the project is to build a model to predict the state of environmental variables such as the PM10. The prediction will be compared with that from the [CAMS service](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-europe-air-quality-forecasts). The prediction provided by the CAMS are the result of an ensemble of 9 air quality numerical models. An air quality model integrates a dynamical model of the atmosphere with the chemical-physical equations of the air components. The CAMS numerical models use as input the data assimilated from a network of ground stations and satellite sensors and return as output a grid that represents the horizontal and vertical distribution of the air quality variables with a prediction of their future state.      \n"
