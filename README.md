Data Science  
===========
I use this repository for my projects about data science and statistical inference. The main projects are

 - [covid19 monitoring notebook](python/covid19/covid19-monitoring-notebook.ipynb) is a single notebook in python that monitors the spread of the
    virus in some European countries.
 - [Statistical Learning](r/stat_learning/chapter1.ipynb) is a collection of notebooks in R with my notes about a course on
statistical inference and worked out examples taken from the book used in the course.
 - [Bayesian Inference](r/rethinking/probability.ipynb) is a collection
of notes about probability and bayesian inference and R scripts taken
from the books I am using for this project.  
- [Copernicus](python/copernicus/copernicus_services.ipynb) notebooks about climate change using the Copernicus
data.
- [Digital Image Processing](python/imaging/digital_image_processing.ipynb) notebooks about digital image processing, mostly images from satellites.  

A list of open data sets about science, economics, finance, and health is available [here](datasets.md).
