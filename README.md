Data Science  
============
I use this repository for my projects about data science and statistical inference. The main projects are

 - [Python Cookbook](python/README.md) Python data structures, and code examples using the Python core packages for data science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.
 - [covid19 monitoring notebook](python/covid19/covid19-monitoring-notebook.ipynb) is a single notebook in python that monitors the spread of the
    virus in some European countries.
 - [Statistical Learning](r/stat_learning/chapter1.ipynb) is a collection of notebooks in R with my notes about a course on
statistical inference and worked out examples taken from the book used in the course.
 - [Bayesian Inference](r/rethinking/probability.ipynb) is a collection
of notes about probability and bayesian inference and R scripts taken
from the books I am using for this project.  

The Digital Image Processing folder has been moved to a new repository [dip](https://github.com/luigiselmi/dip). The copernicus folder has been moved to the new repository [copernicus](https://github.com/luigiselmi/copernicus). The iia folder has been moved to the new [climate]() repository.

## Open data
A list of open data sets about science, economics, finance, and health is available [here](datasets.md).

## Probabilistic programming
